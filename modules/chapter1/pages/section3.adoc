= AWX Environment

Given the challenging and time-consuming nature of AWX deployment, we have bypassed the complexity by deploying the AWX lab ourselves. You can now access the pre-configured environment, please refer to the following login procedure:

Here are the steps to log in to the AWX application on an OpenShift cluster: 

. Login to *OpenShift Admin Console* using the credentials shared on the RHDP log in page. 

. Select the project as `awx`. 

. Go to `Networking` -->  `Routes` to access the `awx URL`. 

. Go to `Workloads` --> `Secrets` --> `awx-demo-admin-password` for the `admin` user password for login.


NOTE: Create Resources on the AWX, which can be confirmed after migration. The following video tutorial will help in doing that or you can create according to your requirement
